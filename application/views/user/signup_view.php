	<h1> Welcome to Kikr! </h2>

	<h2> Kikr is a new system for earning cool discounts and rewards for social loyalty. </h3>

	<h2> You'll have to <?php echo $echo; ?> first to see the new hotness, but before you do, you should probably 
		 read a bit about privacy and security and how this works: </h2>
	<h3> Kikr does its magic by "pushing" us your Foursquare checkins. We don't care what 
	you do in your free time, but any checkin you make at a Kikr-enabled venue will be visible to store 
	employees. This allows them to give you awesome rewards and discounts for referring your friends! </h3>
