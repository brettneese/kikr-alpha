Notes:

This is the first thing I've built, I'm releasing 98% of it as open source, but I'm saving our custom CSS files for future use. They shouldn't be hard to rebuild from http://jquerymobile.com. 

It requires Foursquare API credentials, Pusher credentials and Stephen Young's PHP library (https://github.com/stephenyoung/php-foursquare) It's still broken in many places. Have fun. Stride cautiously. Don't hate. Feel free to contact me.
